# poke5e

A project to help me DM on a 5E campaign

Goal: To have a text based alternative to the heroku dex

Stretch Goals:

- Make prettier front end
- Generate mons when given mon and level
- Export generated mon to a format that can be imported to Roll20
- Generate groups based on themes/types?
- Populate Database automatically (gonna be a nightmare if I cant figure this out)
- Suggestions based on current text

Current Progress: (not final and will be changing future steps as I realize I'm bad at planning)

1: Planing

2: Scraper PoC <-----

3: Database Creation (IaC) Postgres

4: Setup Queries

5: Create a function that returns a mon with all information that the heroku dex would return

6: Create function that return a readable output out of the previous function

7: Create full scraper

8: Finish Database Setup

9: Start Stretch goals (see above)
